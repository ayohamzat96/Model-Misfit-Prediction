# Model-Misfit-Prediction
## This project utilized supervised regression techniques to predict the values of simulated oil reservoir model misfit from their production parameters (deviation from real value). 
## These predicted misfits were then used to back-estimate the optimal production parameters that can be used in history matching and forecasting future production by oil and gas companies.
## Some of the algorithms used include K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines and Random Forest
## The project makes use of standard data handling practices including data visualization, cleaning & preprocessing, data scaling and inverse scaling.
